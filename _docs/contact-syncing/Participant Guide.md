> What is data curation?

Data curation aids in preserving the value of research data for the long-term by optimizing data for discoverability, interoperability, and reusability (Munoz & Renear 2011; Johnston et al., 2018; Thomer et al, 2022). For more specifics on data curation in practice see the definition below provided by Zorich 1995:

“Data sets need to be examined for consistency, long-term quality and relevance over time, and new sources of data must be identified and assessed. Changes or updates to data require authentication and verification. Tools which support object databases, such as authority lists, thesauri, data dictionaries and other documentation resources, need to be maintained, updated and distributed at regular intervals, while data security and access must be considered. All these concerns constitute the discipline of data curation.”
