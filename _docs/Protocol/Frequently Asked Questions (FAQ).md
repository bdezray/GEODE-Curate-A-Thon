#Relevance

**Q: How should we handle plant grafts and clonal populations that were taken from the wild?**

We are prioritizing natural populations in this Curate-A-Thon. We can take any biosample that was born as the result of a sexual reproduction event in “the wild”.

**Q: How should we handle projects/studies that include both domestic varieties and their wild counterparts, as well as hybrids?**

Prioritize projects for which either at least 50% of BioSamples are from natural populations or at least 50% of sampled populations are natural populations.

**Q: How should I handle wild-caught BioSamples that were taken from markets?**

 Read in the materials and methods to see if you can learn about how the authors established provenance and sampling locality. Try to understand what geographic locality and associated uncertainty is ascribed by the authors when making their inference.

 #GEODE

**Q: How do I find out more about these metadata initiatives and contribute?**

The rationale for, and capability of, the Genomics Observatories Metadatabase (GEOME) is described in Deck et al. (2017) and Riginos et al. (2020). We encourage you to also visit the webpage (www.geome-db.org) and explore GEOME. You are welcome to request to join an existing project or team, or to create your own. We also invite feedback on current functionality and ways in which GEOME may better accommodate your research needs. If you see the value of GEOME, you can promote its wider use by encouraging colleagues, students, and authors of manuscripts you review or handle as an editor.
