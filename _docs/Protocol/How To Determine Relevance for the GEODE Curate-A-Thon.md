title: How to Determine Relevance for the GEODE Curate-A-Thon
category: Protocol
order: 3
---

Relevance for the Curate-A-Thon will be based on what BioProjects have sample information relevant to biodiversity monitoring:

>BioProjects are determined to be **relevant** is the majority (>50%) of BioSamples come from wild populations, including introduced and invasive species.

>BioProjects are determined to be **not relevant** if BioSamples come from domesticated species, lab or brood stock, human pathogens, and/or quantitative genetic studies.

To determine relevance, you will first need to locate the associated published paper to find more information about the BioProject.
- If a BioProject is **relevant**, you will complete the associated Google Form and include the paperâ€™s Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in the appropriate field. For relevant BioProjects, you will also need to provide information about any metadata that you are able to locate (e.g. the spatial and/or temporal metadata). More information about the Google Form is outlined below.
- If a BioProject is **not relevant**, you will complete and submit the associated Google Form and move onto the next BioProject.
