> **Problem Statement:**

INSDC houses lots of genomic/genetic sequences from a breadth of sample types such as space samples, covid samples, medical human samples, barnacles, etc. to name a few. Currently, there is not an easy way to sort/filter sequence data in INSDC to find datasets relevant to biodiversity conservation and monitoring which focuses on wild populations. The information necessary to do this and to reuse the dataset itself in the future is usually in associated papers. Therefore, we need you to determine the relevance of BioProjects for this Curate-A-Thon as well as discover missing metadata by locating associated, published scientific papers and metadata that correspond to each BioProject.

> **Instructions:**

Please read through the protocol instructions before you begin your first data curation review.

Overall, the curation you will be involved in will progress through the following steps:
1. Search for published papers associated with the assigned BioProject using the [Paper Search Strategies](https://bdezray.github.io/Geode-Curate-A-Thon/_docs/Protocol/Paper Search Strategies.md) provided.
2. Link the BioProject record to the associated published paper in the GEODE Curate-A-Thon Google Form (see the [BioProjects Google Form Overview](https://bdezray.github.io/Geode-Curate-A-Thon/_docs/Protocol/BioProjects Google Form.md) for more information).
3. Determine BioProject relevance for GEODE based on information within the associated published paper. Directions on how to determine relevance are available in the [How to Determine Relevance for the GEODE Curate-A-Thon](https://bdezray.github.io/Geode-Curate-A-Thon/_docs/Protocol/How To Determine Relevance for the GEODE Curate-A-Thon.md) section of this protocol. Enter the relevance status into the BioProjects Google Form.
4. If the Bioproject is determined to be relevant, determine whether or not spatial (information about the location where a sample was collected (e.g., location name, latitude/longitude)) or temporal (information about when a sample of collected (e.g., date, date range)) metadata can be located within the published paper or associated documents (supplemental materials, data repository, etc.). Enter this information in the BioProjects Google Form.

>The work you will be doing during this Curate-A-Thon is important as it will have a direct impact on future use of these genomic/genetic sequence data because reuse depends on **correct, well documented** information being associated with each record. Therefore, we have provided you with several resources throughout this guide that will assist you in the process (e.g., tutorial videos, guidance, etc.), BUT please do not hesitate to reach out to your Curate-A-Thon hosts, with any questions throughout the process.
