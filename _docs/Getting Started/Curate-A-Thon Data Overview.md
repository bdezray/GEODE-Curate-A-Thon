> **About The Data You Will Be Curating**

Today, we will be working with the metadata associated with genetic and genomic sequence data extracted from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) database.

To best be prepared to work with this data, it is important to understand a few elements regarding how the data are structured and accession numbers assigned (Figure 1).

The first level of structure is the BioProject.

>**BioProject:** a collection of biological data for a single initiative, originating from a single organization or from a consortium. This is the umbrella under which all sample information and sequence data files are submitted and thus provides users a single place to find links to the diverse data generated for that project and deposited into the archival databases maintained by members of the INSDC. Often, the BioProject includes information about: data type, sample scope, organism or common taxonomic branch (e.g., primates), BioProject release date, and potentially research grant information as well as Biosample and publication information.
    BioProject Accession Number Format: PRJNAxxxxxx (e.g., PRJNA526235)
      Note: BioProject accession numbers are not recommended for citation in manuscripts with preference for GenBank, WGS, or SRA accession numbers. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/docs/faq/#what-is-a-bioproject) However, you will frequently find BioProjects referenced in manuscript data availability statements.
