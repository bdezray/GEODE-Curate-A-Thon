> **International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC):**
consists of a joint effort to collect and disseminate databases containing DNA and RNA sequences. It involves a collaboration between the following databases: [DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ)](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index-e.html), [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), and [GenBank (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). New and updated data on nucleotide sequences contributed by research teams to each of the three databases are synchronized on a daily basis.

> **Nucleotide:**
The basic building block of nucleic acids (RNA and DNA).

> **Genetic and genomic sequence data:**
The sequence of nucleotides which tell scientists the kind of genetic information that is carried by a particular segment of DNA or RNA. For example, scientists can use sequence information to determine which stretches of DNA contain genes and which stretches carry regulatory instructions, turning genes on or off.

> **Genetic diversity:**
The combined differences in the DNA of all individuals in a species make up the genetic diversity of that species. Genetic diversity causes individuals to have different characteristics. Learn more by reading the article: [What is Genetic Diversity and Why Does it Matter?](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2021.656168).

> **Metadata:**
Information about a data set that is structured (often in machine-readable format) for purposes of search and retrieval. Metadata elements may include basic information (e.g., title, author, date created, etc.) and/or specific elements inherent to datasets (e.g., spatial coverage, time periods).

> **Digital Object Identifier (DOI):**
A string of numbers, letters, and symbols used to uniquely identify an article or document and to provide it with a permanent web address (URL).

> **Online Repository:**
An archive or collection of documents such as journal articles, datasets, presentations, etc. An online repository can be for general use, institutional use, and/or discipline specific use. Some examples include [Dyrad](https://datadryad.org/stash), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), [ScholarSphere](https://scholarsphere.psu.edu).
