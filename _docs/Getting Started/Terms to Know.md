> **Metadata:**
Information about a data set that is structured (often in machine-readable format) for purposes of search and retrieval. Metadata elements may include basic information (e.g., title, author, date created, etc.) and/or specific elements inherent to datasets (e.g., spatial coverage, time periods) (Data Curation Network Data Curation Glossary).

> **International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC):**
consists of a joint effort to collect and disseminate databases containing DNA and RNA sequences. It involves a collaboration between the following databases: [DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ)](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index-e.html), [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), and [GenBank (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). New and updated data on nucleotide sequences contributed by research teams to each of the three databases are synchronized on a daily basis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nucleotide_Sequence_Database_Collaboration).
