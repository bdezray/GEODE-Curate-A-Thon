> **Problem Statement:**

INSDC houses lots of genomic/genetic sequences from a breadth of sample types such as space samples, covid samples, medical human samples, barnacles, etc. to name a few. Currently, there is not an easy way to sort/filter sequence data in INSDC to find datasets relevant to biodiversity conservation and monitoring which focuses on wild populations. The information necessary to do this and to reuse the dataset itself in the future is usually in associated papers. Therefore, we need you to determine the relevance of BioProjects for this Curate-A-Thon as well as discover missing metadata by locating associated, published scientific papers and metadata that correspond to each BioProject.

> **Instructions:**

Please read through the instructions before you begin your first data curation review. The work you will be doing during this Curate-A-Thon is important as it will have a direct impact on future use of these genomic/genetic sequence data because reuse depends on **correct, well documented** information being associated with each record. Therefore, we have provided you with several resources throughout this guide that will assist you in the process (e.g., tutorial videos, guidance, etc.), BUT please do not hesitate to reach out to your Curate-A-Thon hosts, with any questions throughout the process.
