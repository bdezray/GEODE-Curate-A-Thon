Welcome to the GEODE: A Genomics Observatories Diversity Explorer Curate-A-Thon! The purpose of the GEODE Curate-A-Thon is to enhance the metadata associated with sequence data to improve discoverability, interoperability, and reusability. Your work during the Curate-A-Thon will help us achieve this goal!

Let's get started!

1. **Read the Getting Started Guide** The getting started guide will orient you to the project, data curation, and the work you will do to discover and connect sequence data records to associated metadata.
2. **Curate assigned BioProject records** Once you have read the getting started guide and been assigned a BioProject to curate, you will be able to navigate to the pre-filled Google Form for that specific BioProject to document your curation efforts. For each assigned BioProject, determine relevance, discover and link associated published papers, and locate missing spatio-temporal metadata. Learn more by reading our Curate-A-Thon guide.

Have a question or comment about the Curate-A-Thon process or data curation in general? You have options:
- Connect with your Curate-A-Thon host live during the Zoom session.
- Send us a message via xxxx.
